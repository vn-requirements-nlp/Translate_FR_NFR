There can be any number of mirror servers readily available in case of huge loads without the user getting any delay.
The website must provide highest degree of security to the registered users. All the transactions that are made must be secured. The sensitive information passed to and from the website must be secured. Identity theft and other security related issues must be solved. Unauthorized transmission of sensitive information of the user to third party websites for reference must be avoided. On the basis of user agreement the information must be processed.

The System must be able to retrieve and display within 20 seconds the case which has not been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for cases where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active records.
Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.
Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines
Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements.
Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences.
The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points.
The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.
Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171.
When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable.
The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.
Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.
Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page.
The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5-8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use.
User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.
Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.
Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the userâ€™s task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information.
Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered.
Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account.
Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.
Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.
Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110.
Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality.
The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241.
The user interfaces should be designed to make them user intuitive;
The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled.
Navigation links â€” particularly links representing the main navigation structure â€” should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems.
Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard.
The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as â€œgoâ€� or â€œclick hereâ€� except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the userâ€™s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.
Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and Hpresentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results.
The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 10-15 seconds regardless of the storage capacity or number of cases in the system. In this context, performing a search means returning a result list. It does not include retrieving the records themselves.
In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the System (with inline synchronization) within no more than (xx) hours.
The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed (x) per (rolling three month period).
Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed (xx hours/minutes) per (rolling three month period).
The System is considered to be down if any user is unable to perform any normal System function and if this failure is attributed to any component of the System other than the workstation.
The planned downtime for the System must not exceed (xx) hours per (rolling three month period).
The System must be available to users: from (xx:00) to (xx:00), on (all weekdays/xxx days per year);
The user interfaces of the system should follow the guidelines specified under www.usability.gov.
If user-specified profiles are used, users should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand.
If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.
It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.
When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.
Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userâ€™s behaviour and adapting to the userâ€™s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.
Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.
If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.
A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.
Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.
Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.
Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.
Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.
If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page.
Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness).
The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.
â€œWhite spaceâ€� on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded.
If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation).

Data transmission format. Data is transmitted between Gemini and home Institutes using a FITS format and contains all header information provided with the data.
System-wide data capacity. The data capacity of the system is limited by transfer methods and technology, as well as archiving capacity on site. The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or similar medium.
The system must allow for fast transmission of rough images every 0.5 sec. This may be assisted through the use of data-loss compression techniques (e.g. JPEG, MPEG, etc).
In addition, there is the need for transmission of images matching the original resolution. This high-quality transmission must require less than 20 sec, and can only be assisted with loss-less compression.
Every command must be accepted/rejected within 2 sec and before the corresponding action occurs. (This is different than the ACK/NAK response of the communications protocol - here, the target system must have examined the command and verified its validity.
The telescope and instrument software shall contain built-in test (BIT) facilities to verify Gemini 8m Telescopes system and Gemini 8m Telescopes software performances.
Requests of subsystems for status information must be answered within 5 sec and be possible in maintenance level operation.
Requirements for response times within the user interfaces are given in the User Interface requirements section.
Every Gemini 8m Telescopes software module shall have corresponding test specifications to check normal operation of releases, to be used both for acceptance tests and as an on-line test procedure.
The Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall also provide for execution of self-test sequences of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system and subsystems. These shall automatically exercise all subsystems present in a given operational configuration.
Storage of data. Data from all instruments and detectors is stored as compressed data, using a standard format. There is a first level of storage within IOCs, to secure data in the event of link failures.
Status display update must be within 4 sec at the local stations (certain functions, such as telescope position, may have tighter constraints). Remote station update response is given in the Requirements for Remote Operations section.
Data acquisition format. Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data, but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission from the Gemini system or across the system LAN. The goal of compression is to minimize bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on removable media.
Data flow. Data from detectors must be stored in the most effective method permitted by available technology. Astronomical data is often detector readout limited so that disk access and data transfer times are not significant.
For mosaicked, large optical detectors, a full readout of the detector must be done in about 2 or 3 minutes.
All software bugs should be logged and then fixed as soon as possible after detection. The goal is to have restart conditions occur only on hardware failure.
Concurrent data access and display. Since the Gemini system supports monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple, simultaneous access to data. Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and attached workstations therefore imposes significant transfer requirements on the LAN. The LAN must support a transfer rate of 20-40 Mbits/second.
The syntax of control flow commands is to be consistent across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software.
All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests.
All IOC subsystems must respond to additional common commands for such activities as start, stop, initialize, reset parameters, etc.
Fault recovery, exception handling, fail-safe checks, etc. should be used to improve reliability.
Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec, signaling acceptance of each command.
For commands allowing delayed replies, timeouts for that reply must also be supported.
Peak control information within the system is expected to be 100 TPS. This assumes bridging between communication sections, to isolate traffic in relevant sections only.
For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time is about 0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time.
The support structure for communicating commands must be reliable, with a uniform ACK/NAK protocol adopted across all systems. Timeouts must be supported at approximately 500 msec.

The trigger value is used in combination with the current temperature to determine when a heating or cooling unit shall be turned on or off.
There shall be a maximum number of heating or cooling units that can be on at any given time. This procedure loads the maximum number of concurrently running units allowed.
Each thermostat shall have a unique identifier by which that thermostat is identified in the THEMAS system. This procedure will load these definitions into the THEMAS software.
The definitions of the individual heating and cooling systems reside in an initialization file. The system shall read this file and the definitions shall be derived from the initialization data in the file.
The THEMAS system shall control the heating and cooling units that are defined as part of the THEMAS system.

Clinical specimen data should include information about the specimen source/site from which the specimen was taken, symptom date of onset, and whether the sample is acute or convalescent.
Systems supporting OM should be able to support the inclusion of labeling, packaging and shipping instructions (e.g., container type, storage condition, preservative), and the shipping manifest with batch shipments of specimens/samples.
The subject of a specimen/sample collected for laboratory testing must be linked to the specimen/sample by an identifier (i.e., Subject ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction.
Systems supporting OM must be able to store data about the specimens/samples that are collected for laboratory testing. Examples of this data are: Specimen ID, Subject ID, purpose for test, collection date and time, subject type (e.g., human, plant, animal, food), specimen category, specimen type, suspected agent, risk indicator (e.g., infectious, radioactive, corrosive), person performing specimen/sample collection (including contact information), location of collection, and volume and quantity details.
Demographic information should be collected about the investigator, including their name, address, and contact information, so that the investigator may be contacted to answer questions or to provide additional information.
Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls. For example, controls share demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with the agent that is the focus of the investigation.
Both the jurisdiction investigating the event and the jurisdiction reporting the cases and associated investigations must be captured. For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence and investigated by the jurisdiction visited.
Detailed data must be collected about the source of exposure as well as the exposed entity to support contact exposure tracing. Exposure data related to both the potential source and the potential spread include the entityâ€™s type, Subject ID, Contact ID, contactâ€™s name and address, exposure dates and times, health status, and priority code.

The Pontis 5.0 repository must be able to store the following quantities of bridges, work recommendations, scenarios, projects, and users at a minimum:
The administrator shall be able to add custom structure lists.
A standalone database engine will continue to be necessary. Performance objectives for the standalone database should be comparable.
Some of these factors may make it impossible to achieve the performance requirements for Pontis 5.0 outlined in this section. However, based on our assessment of the existing condition of most agency systems and infrastructure, we think this outcome is unlikely.
There are selected licensees, typically smaller agencies, who may have much lower powered computer resources, and their performance must be acceptable as well, although not necessarily comparable to larger installations.
This section presents speed targets for specific system functions. The apparent speed of many operations will be affected by network latency (delays due to transmission of text and images from the Pontis application server to the client desktop machine and web browser, or for standalone operations). The times indicated in the table represent user-experienced response times.
The target times indicated in the table represent 90% thresholds â€“ that is, the performance requirement specified here means that the indicated functions will take less than the indicated length of time an average of 9 out of 10 times.
Pontis 5.0 is not strictly a transactional application or mission-critical for most capabilities. In light of this, the application shall be available for use 18 hours per day, 353 days per year, reserving 6 hours per day and one day per month for routine agency network and infrastructure maintenance. During normal times of operation, Pontis shall achieve 98 percent up time.
Because Pontis 5.0 is not a mission-critical application, there will be no attempt to design or construct the system for uninterrupted operation. Agencies may choose to implement database transaction logging, mirroring, or switchover to backup servers in the event of a hardware or network failure, but support for these decisions or implementation are beyond the scope of Pontis 5.0 effort. Procedures and equipment for backups (database and software) and disaster recovery are also outside the scope of this effort.
The Pontis application server (ASP.NET) software will run on a server located within a (presumably) secure facility at each agency. Because it is an ASP.NET application, the end users can vary in location depending on the network accessibility of the server. The Pontis database, and any other databases to be accessed from Pontis may be co-located on the same server machine, but at a minimum must be accessible from the Pontis application server via standard database communication and connection protocols.
The server machine will run Windows Server 2003 or, given technology evolution, a descendant target server environment identified in the implementation plan. The server machine must have all necessary software to run an ASP.NET application. This specifically includes, but may not be limited to, IIS30, the .NET Framework and ASP.NET. Other web servers, appliances, and add-in technologies may also be necessary depending on the final application design.
The effective speed and congestion levels on the network that connects the servers and client machines running the application; and
Back-end server stored procedures and server-side functions will be supported and may be assumed to be usable in the technical design of Pontis 5.0. This will require implementation of the triggers in native DBMS procedural code. This implies that it is very likely that the server-side code will vary for each target DBMS, even if the interfaces remain identical, increasing the development and testing effort with the significant benefit of assigning processing to the appropriate application tier(s).
Standalone capabilities will require a workstation running the latest .NET Framework, presumably Windows XP Professional (SP2) or its successor. Some capabilities may require a network connection. The workstationâ€™s hardware requirements will be similar to those of the existing Pontis 4.4 application. There will continue to be a standalone/runtime database engine provided with the application for offline work. The offline database is assumed to be Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere release 9 or above.
Pontis 5.0 security is a mix of database security and application security. Overall security is provided by the database and the Pontis 5.0 user authentication mechanisms with more refined security over program capabilities - e.g. create a bridge - being addressed by the application.
It is assumed that authentication will utilize a single sign-on (SSO) approach and application security will be declaratively managed through database or directory entries, rather than hard-wired into the application. This mechanism may have implications for BRIDGEWare/AASHTOWare generally and will need to be coordinated with the other AASHTO products31.
Database security will need to be insured for the Pontis data stored in the RDBMS; most likely this will be done by using a specific username/password combination and running as particular database roles for each database connection. This security structure should be similar to the existing security approach in Pontis 4.x. For web clients, care will be taken to insure that connection information is not accessible from application pages (e.g., userid/password embedded in HTML form variables).
The application level security controls will be consistent with current Pontis 4.x procedures, except more comprehensive; no exceptional controls are required. A specific requirement addresses field-level data security.
For normal users, the configurability of the system via the interface will be limited to changing the parameters used to perform the various analyses and modeling functions. Access to all other configuration parameters, such as module access, will be restricted to Pontis super users or application administrators.
There are no specific privacy or immunity (antivirus) requirements for Pontis 5.0 identified at this time.
The system shall be capable of exporting the NBI data in the specified NBI format as outlined in the NBI guideline. The system shall be capable supporting the future NBI coding guide changes.
The system shall provide data review wizard for comparing incoming bridge data with existing data. The errors will be highlighted for easy review.
Pontis 5.0 will be designed to be used with Internet Explorer; it may work correctly with other browsers but this cannot be guaranteed. Given the predominance of IE in the browser market, it does not appear to be necessary to consider support for other browsers, although this may need to be reconsidered if external customers are running the application(s) and need to employ different browser technology such as Netscape or Mozilla FireFox.
The administrator shall be able to configure definitions of element types, environments, materials, and categories.
The speed of the servers on which Pontis, the RDBMS, the analytical and other processing engines, and other information resources are installed;
Integrating DataWindow .NET is likely a short-term strategy to ease migration of user forms and reports to Pontis 5.0. A stated objective for Pontis 5.0 is eliminating dependency on PowerBuilder. Ideally, the application should not require any particular vendor technology for report or form generation, such as InfoMaker/PowerBuilder, so a sunset plan must be developed to outline a strategy to meet this objective. However, the application shall continue to provide a plug-in capability to integrate third-party .NET data displays and reports in the user workspace.
The administrator shall be able to add custom project lists.
The administrator shall be able to configure default values for various scenario parameters.

The system shall provide an interface to communicate with an external service or third-party software. A set of standard interfaces25 will be defined for this capability.
The capacity and speed of the commercial RDBMS product used for the data repository;
The system shall provide application administrators with a secured tool for overriding bridge/project check-out status.
The system shall provide a fixed set of predefined, secured, administration reports to document users, user roles, application privileges, user login sessions, checked-out bridges, and other key information necessary to manage application operation.
The EIM&DSS design will be informed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) design guidelines26 and conform to common industry practices for user interaction behavior and user interface design. For the thin-client portion of Pontis, the AASHTO standards for thin-client web-based applications software will be followed.
The software, through its user interface, will clearly identify the product name (Pontis 5.0.x), the licensee, the connected user, and the organization that developed the system (AASHTO). Additional session identification information will be available on demand.27 The overall look and feel of the product will be that of a professional and conservative application.
Pontis 5.0 will, at AASHTOâ€™s direction, adopt any elements of the look and feel of other existing AASHTOWare/BRIDGEWare applications where appropriate. In particular, UI conventions from Virtis/Opis will be reviewed to ensure that the Pontis 5.0 does not differ markedly in appearance. AASHTO may designate such model applications and must provide the development team with access to fully-documented style sheets/UI layouts or demonstration software to support this requirement.
There will be no support for individual personalization of the user interface (skins) other than the availability of certain features that are tied to a user role (e.g. not all users will have the ability to edit bridge data and thus will not see an â€œEdit Onâ€� button on the corresponding screen).
Pontis 5.0 will be designed to be as straightforward and intuitive as possible, and familiar to existing users. The user interface will provide effective navigation, visual referencing, and task sequencing. Users will have access to on-line help throughout the UI.
The application should look and feel consistent in the web and standalone operating environments, therefore it will conform to standard .NET standalone and web application conventions with necessary accommodations for the deployment environment only where these prove necessary and appropriate.
As a general goal, Pontis users should be comfortable operating and using the software after two full days of training. Users who only wish to access and display bridge information should be comfortable operating and using the software after two hours of training. System administrators should be comfortable operating and maintaining the software after user training and one full day of system administration training.
The system developer shall consider supporting existing custom forms and reports developed in PowerBuilder 9. It shall decide on a development tool for users so that they can continue to customize Pontis and extend its capability. For example, custom forms and reports created with PowerBuilder 9 may be migrated to a .NET application by using the Sybase DataWindow .NET technology which is available in PowerBuilder 10.

The agency shall therefore be able to enforce strict use of calculated translator results for calculating NBI condition ratings.
The system shall be capable of prompting users when the dependent fields for ratings are changed and offer the user option to recalculate the ratings.
The system administrator shall be able to configure the recalculation behavior of the derived data. The options shall include 1) do nothing, 2) alert user that recalculation is required and give option to recalculate before update/save, and 3) recalculate silently with no confirmation prompt when user saves the inspection.
The system shall be capable of calculating appraisal ratings.
The system shall be capable of creating cost and deterioration elicitation records for Pontis users.
The system shall be capable of updating the transition probabilities for preservation actions based on expert elicitations.

The system shall be capable of using the transition probabilities and preservation action costs to develop an optimal preservation policy as detailed in the Pontis Technical Manual.
The system shall be capable of recovering the model if the elicitation process fails.
The system shall be capable of restoring the previous action costs, transition probabilities, and preservation policy.
The system shall eliminate any and all dependencies on workstation (user) control/parameter files for program operation. For example, parameter information required by the NBI Translator (including information currently stored in ELEMENTS.PRN and ERRORS.LST) will be stored strictly within the Pontis database rather than on individual user workstations.
The system shall be capable of supporting multiple cost and deterioration models.
The system has an embedded help file that contains basic solutions and hints for problematic situations
PR-1: The system should be executed without problems in a machine that fulfills the requirements of the Java runtime environment [2].
PR-2: The basic artificial intelligence must operate fast enough. The next move should be calculated within 10 seconds.
The system does not use or receive network connections and is used locally. This means that no network safety requirements exist. Overwriting an existing file on the file system has to be confirmed from the user to prevent accidental loss of data.
No personal information is stored by the system so no specific security requirements need to be defined.
The system functions on a computer that has a screen for output and keyboard or mouse or both for input.
SQA-1: The system shall run well on both Linux and Windows and should be playable with the mouse or the keyboard or both.
The user interface uses one main window for the actual game playing and dialog windows for changing the general settings of the system.

The Framework API should expose at least the following functionality to client processes: Create, delete and modify Entities and Entity groups; Create, delete and modify relationships between Entities; List and access Entities with an API similar to that of a standard file system API; Execute queries for the retrieval of Entities using different criteria.
GUIs associated with the Framework SHOULD be designed such that an user with basic understanding of the Windows 2000/XP operating systems would instinctively be able to interact with them. Therefore, most GUIs MAY need to closely mimic popular Windows applications.
At this stage of the development, the Framework MAY only operate in single user mode, with no networking capabilities.
The Framework Shell SHOULD NOT utilize more than 40 megabytes of RAM.
The Framework MUST guard against malicious scripts on remote websites from accessing its information. The Framework MUST guard against unintended corruption of information by the user himself.
All proprietary trademarks, product names and/or logos used on this document are trademarks of their respective owners.
All components associated with Project ZNIX should conform to the following standards: Windows 2000 Logo Requirements [WWW05].
At this stage of development Project ZNIX requires no communication interfaces.
The online help system should be compiled utilizing as much of non-technical terms as possible. Care SHOULD be taken not to produce an exhaustive user documentation as that would defeat the main purpose of the system as expressed in the introduction to section 2. A comprehensive Developerâ€™s Guide MAY be compiled to facilitate 3rd party ZNIX-aware applications.
A GUI capable of browsing the information managed by the Framework, similar to that of the Windows Explorer SHOULD be available to the user. The GUI MUST also be capable of allowing the user to specify relationships between disparate Entities as he see fit.
Provisions SHOULD be made so that at least the following 3rd party applications can take advantage of the Framework for the specified types of information.
Therefore, some residue MUST be left on the data store to indicate that a portion of data has been archived. For example, assume all information relating to a â€œPersonâ€� Entity named John is archived to a CD-ROM. When the user subsequently looks for John, the Framework SHOULD NOT declare that such an Entity was not found. Rather, it SHOULD inform the user that the Entity has been archived (and OPTIONALLY, if he wishes to proceed, to remount the relevant storage device).
Any coding conventions to be used during implementation MUST be documented before the beginning of the phase, and strictly adhered to during the phase.
Project ZNIX SHOULD be available to its potential users in source and binary from, and free of charge. The project MAY be hosted on a popular Open Source distribution website such that the Open Source community is aware of (and contribute to) its existence. The website for distributing the project SHALL include provisions for the users to make comments on the product as well as to compile a wish-list of features.
ZNIX Framework will be licensed under GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) [WWW03]. The browser and any other tool released alongside the Framework will be licensed under GNU Public License (GPL) [WWW04].
The system SHALL conform to ISO 10646 (Unicode UTF-8) and OPTIONALLY ISO 10646-1 (Unicode UTF-16) standards for character set encoding. [WWW06] Additionally, design of the system MAY yield a new set of standards that ZNIXaware client processes MAY need to conform to.
Often, the user may want to archive portions of the information-store to removable storage media (the term storage media covers only CD-ROMs and USB Pen Drives at this point). However, this SHOULD not mean that such portions would be â€œforgottenâ€� by the Framework.
Mean Time between Failure (MTBF): The mean time between failures (MTBF) SHALL exceed 3 months.
The document is automatically saved to disk in a manner that reflects the relationships it has to other Entities. The user may in the future fetch this document by following the relationship paths that he had created.
The user MUST be able to view the information in the central store in a hierarchical manner that makes sense to him. Section 3.1.1 describes how this hierarchy is built up. The Framework SHOULD include a browser that is capable of displaying this hierarchy in a UI similar to that of the Windows Explorer. The browser MAY OPTIONALLY be integrated directly in to Windows Explorer, rather than being a standalone application. This browser MAY integrate the GUI described in section 3.1.1.5 as well.
The Framework MUST be capable of capturing information form the software tools specified in Table 3.9.3-A. The data captured SHOULD be stored in a centralized data store. The Framework MAY decide whether the information should be stored as Entities or Associates. The data capturing and archiving mechanisms MAY resemble the following.
User SHOULD be able to modify, add, delete or group these Entities by navigating to a virtual folder (e.g. /People/).
The email is intercepted before it is dispatched to the SMTP server.
An Associate is created to contain the message body.
The recipient name(s) are used to create (if required) Entities under the â€œPeopleâ€� category. The Associate is then linked to each Entity.
The email is fetched from the POP3 server.
The Address Book is used to create Entities under the category â€œPeopleâ€� (Category names are user definable. However, a certain set of categories like People, Email etc. MAY need to always be present).
The senderâ€™s name is used to create Entities, under the category â€œPeopleâ€�. The Associate is then linked to this Entity.
User SHOULD be able to specify when he is to start a research project; i.e. when the web sites he visits subsequently are to be permanently stored.
The project name specified by the user spawns a new Entity in the Framework.
An associate is created as an archive and is linked to this Entity.
The user after editing a document in a word-processor invokes a special GUI supplied by the Framework.
The GUI allows him to draw arrows to and from (a symbol representing) the current document to any Entity creating relationships between the document and the relevant Entities.
The user may optionally specify a descriptive name for the document.
The system shall use the current corporate standard Microsoft SQL Server database engine.
Data uploading and management will likely be done as infrequently as once a year. This fact greatly limits the complexity of the user interface and the learning curve needed for completing this task.
Database Design: The database structure should be as complete as possible during the design stage but there should be a room for modification without a large overhaul during later phases.
Public users: Eventual release of the database system to the general public will add university and agency researchers who would appear similar in training to the primary users, but also would add clients with the entire range of training and interests. These users would have access to the public data without need for authentication.
Research users: Non-ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes. These would have similar characteristics and needs as ARS users, but because of the agency-level confidentiality issues, could not access the password-protected sensitive data.
Data operations manager: Staff, probably at OCIO, responsible for data archiving and maintenance, requiring read/write/modify privileges to all data in the system. This includes the role commonly thought of as a Database Administrator (DBA).
Watershed uploaders: Staff in the watersheds who have responsibility to upload local data requiring write access to space allocated to their specific watershed.
System operator: Staff at OCIO responsible for maintaining executable code, requiring full access to all aspects of the system.
The system will use, where appropriate, the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools.
Private Network - The system requires a â€œback-endâ€� private network environment in order to ensure that end-user operations (on the front-end) are not impeded by database backups, index propagations, or other large back-end data transfers.
The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security policies applicable.
ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes. These would likely be conversant with the general characteristics of the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating views of the data using database tools such as envisioned for this database system. These users will need user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in CEAP.
As part of standard operating procedures, a testing plan will be documented during the Design phase. The testing plan will be based on user roles, modules or use cases, required tasks and expected outcomes.
Relational Database Management System - As the primary data storage mechanism for the corporate standard relational database management system, Microsoft SQL Server will be required to support system functionality.
An online hierarchical and cross-linked help system in HTML will describe and illustrate all system functions.
An online form will enable users to request help. Frequently asked questions will be screened for the FAQ pages.
The user s guide (or user manual) will contain sufficient information and instructions required to access and use the data system. It will include: Overview of the system features and architecture, Instructions for accessing the system, Samples of screens, where appropriate.
Backup Software â€“ Data and application backups will be managed through fully supported backup software solutions.
HTTP and GIS Server Applications â€“ As the Web will be the primary delivery protocol for the application, HTTP and related GIS server applications will be required to support system functionality.
Web Browsers and Browser Plug-ins â€“ In support of External Interface requirements, commonly supported web browsers will be used to implement a thin-client architecture. The use of Browser plug-ins will be judiciously restricted on an as-needed basis.
Email Servicesâ€“ As a secondary delivery protocol for alerts, data, and other information from the system, email server applications will be required to support system functionality.
The system will use, where appropriate, the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO. This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C# , MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server.
The system will make data available in standardized data formats such as tab-delimited text for use on usersâ€™ client systems including local installations of ARC GIS software or other off-line software applications.
The user interface will be simple and consistent, using terminology commonly understood by the intended users of the system. The system will have a simple interface, consistent with industry standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users. The STEWARDS team will evaluate the user interface of similar systems and apply appropriately. For additional details see Appendix E. User testing will be used to ensure the user interface is clear (simple, commonly understood vocabulary, intuitive to use without training), complete (users can perform all functions from the interface), and consistent (buttons and wording are the same throughout the system).
No extra hardware interfaces are needed. The system will use the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools. This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available.
The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO. This includes, but is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communication with the web browser and the web server and TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol.
Load Balancing - Application Servers and Database servers must be load balanced at the application level to ensure maximum stability and availability. Specific scenarios, such as fail-over versus session-managed load balancing need to be addressed in the functional requirements specification.
A tutorial will provide a quick start, a walk-thru of major system features, and further reference source for the complete system features.
Near-line Storage â€“ All User and Application data as well as software installation and configuration files must be fully backed up week-nightly. Further, secure, off-site storage will be performed on a weekly basis with 24-hour retrieval times.
The system will use the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO. This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C# , MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server.
Implement a database of STEWARDS metadata elements. The database will provide browse and query functionality.
Online Storage - The system needs to be able to store hundreds of megabytes of data on demand. The potential for needing Gigabytes of data storage capacity is also in the realm of possibilities. Further requirements gathering is needed to get real-world estimates of such data storage needs.
Establish a database in support of CEAP that will house the collective data assembled or generated during research activities. The database will support a variety of data types and formats, including but not limited to: spatial data - vector, raster, imagery, and tabular; tabular data â€“ static and time-series; spreadsheets; documents; reports; photographs; and URL links.
The use of agricultural models (SWAT, AnnAGNPS) is a core element of the CEAP effort. Several modeling-related database topics will need to be addressed: 1. Maintenance and reporting of uncertainty or error in measured data, in spatial components of GIS data, and in modeling output. Reporting of uncertainty may take place on an individual sample basis, on a method or procedural basis, or on an entire database. 2. Models will require specific input data and will generate output data during the calibration and validation phases, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory scenarios. The current scope of the STEWARDS system is to provide measured data for input to the model and for comparison to output.
View entire universe of watersheds from top-level screen for selection and Design tools to navigate the individual watershed sites and their data.
View watershed descriptive data and Summary descriptions of research watersheds, stations, and instruments that are useful in describing the research activities should be accessible. This information would not be considered â€˜formalâ€™ metadata.
Provide access to the data via browsing of sites, stations, and instruments; allow for simple queries to individual datasets; provide a metadata search tool to query dataset parameters; and allow for downloading of datasets (full or partial).
Users may wish to examine time-series data, e.g. stream discharge data, over a user-specified time frame in order to select only those data desired for download. Charting tools in association with the query engine are desirable.
Provide access to CEAP-related reports, tables, and project documents.
Agricultural research data are inherently spatial in nature. STEWARDS will provide web-based geographic information tools to allow site-specific data to be viewed within their spatial context. These tools will provide browse and query functionality and support links to download spatial data and their associated tabular data.
Develop and maintain a metadata database that provides browse and query access to formal descriptions of the database elements. Provide tools for database contributors to create and upload metadata compatible with the STEWARDS metadata database.
Develop search tools that query watershed, station, and instrument metadata across the STEWARDS database. Metadata query tools will support query by location, theme, and keyword.
The System shall operate with the following Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator version 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and FireFox.
The System shall operate on Certified and Accredited servers running the current corporate approved versions of operating systems as appropriate.
The Data Management portion of the system shall permit user access from the corporate Intranet and, if a user is authorized for outside access through the corporate firewall, from an Internet connection at the userâ€™s home.
Much of the initial effort in CEAP will focus on the use of agricultural models (e.g. SWAT, AnnAGNPS) in the CEAP watersheds. Users will be able to examine the data used in the modeling effort, visualize the results in their spatial context, and download the model input data and results.
The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.
Implement a web-based browse-and-query tool for searching STEWARDS metadata. Queries by location, theme, and keyword will be supported. A likely scenario involves a web-based wizard which allows users to specify particular querying parameters and then save them for reference later such that time-based comparisons are facilitated with minimal user training.
Implement a metadata input tool that supports creating and editing of metadata in the chosen format. The metadata tool will allow for local and web-based input and editing. A likely scenario involves a web-based wizard which allows users to specify particulars of a data set, and then save those answers and relate them to a particular project, so that these selections can be re-used in future uploading operations.
The Data Research and Reporting portion of the system shall provide public access to reviewed and approved data sets.
Adopt a metadata standard that is compliant with Federal regulations. The current Federal standards for spatial data are the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version 2.0), (http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/contstan.html), FGDC-STD-001-1998. There are some indications that the Federal government may implement the ISO 19115 geographic information/metadata standard in the future. If this occurs, the CEAP database team will evaluate conversion of metadata.
The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability. The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week). For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional â€œdenial of service attacksâ€� is not foreseen as a significant concern.
Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately. STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate. Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.
The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product. Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system. Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process. The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.
STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consistent with ARS OCIO practices, in compliance with agency, Dept and Govt regulations. STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components. They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost. Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.
Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.
Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases. Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less. Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met. In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.
This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.
STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication. Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are. This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated. This is primarily done through userids and passwords.
The system shall provide RAID V Disk Stripping on all database storage disks.
The system shall provide for replication of databases to off-site storage locations.
The system shall provide storage of all databases on redundant computers with automatic switchover.
The user interface for the software shall be compatible to any browser such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla or Netscape Navigator by which user can access to the system.

The e-store system shall communicate with billPay system to identify available payment methods , validate the payments and process payment.
The e-store shall communicate with the content manager to get the product specifications, offerings and promotions.
The e-store system shall communicate with the Configurator to identify all the available components to configure the product.
Since the application must run over the internet, all the hardware shall require to connect internet will be hardware interface for the system. As for e.g. Modem, WAN â€“ LAN, Ethernet Cross-Cable.
The user interface shall be implemented using any tool or software package like Java Applet, MS Front Page, EJB etc.
There shall be logical address of the system in IPv4 format.
The Port number used will be 80.
The protocol used shall be HTTP.
There are many types of interfaces as such supported by the E-Store software system namely; User Interface, Software Interface and Hardware Interface.

A freely available wiki should provide a simple markup language that actors can use to style their input, as well as link to other pages in the wiki. More importantly, having the wiki inside Moodle reduces confusion and allows for the integration of notifications and logins.
Currently, there is no system that allows actors to receive SMS or email notifications of changes to Moodle pages (such as assignments or announcements).
A freely available blog engine should provide all modern blog functionality, such as tagging, drafting, and comments. These blogs should share authentication and notification with Moodle.
The system must provide a blog engine.
The system must provide both e-mail and SMS notifications for pages.
The system must provide a wiki where actors can collaboratively create networks of documents.
The system should display grade information to the appropriate actor.
The system should maintain a history of grades for a particular assignment if the course administrator changes them. This way, another actor can review the grade information if their score on an assignment has changed and they wish to dispute it. Course administrators can also track how they have changed a score over time using the timestamps associated with each change to the gradebook.
The system should maintain a grade history.
The system should display grade information such as the grade for each assignment, averages, and overall grade to the actor to whom the grades belong. No other actor should be able to view anotherâ€™s grades except an actor in the role of course administrator for the course to which the grades belong.
Course administrators should be able to post grades for an assignment based on the ratio of points earned to points possible. The course administrator should also be able to attach feedback in the form of text or an attachment (as described above). Time stamps should be attached to the last time the grade was modified so that actors may examine when particular grades were submitted and how an actor in the role of student has improved or lessened his performance in the course.
For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.). When a page is created, the actor in the role of course administrator should be able to toggle whether notifications are turned on. By default, they should be turned on for announcements. If notifications are turned off, actors in the capacity of student should be able to subscribe to notifications.
The social, collaborative components of Moodle are not very robust. There are better, freelyavailable solutions which should be integrated into Moodle to provide the best functionality possible for all actors without having to use 3rd party services.
Students should be able to select in their preferences whether notifications are sent to their mobile telephone (via SMS) or e-mail account. They should also be able to manage their notification subscriptions (for example, remove themselves from notifications).
A system will be considered to meet this requirement if it has a single administrative interface rather than individual links for editing each page. Furthermore, this interface must allow administrators to easily change themes and other setting that affect page layout across the entire courseware system.
Back-up requirements will need to be determined, based on individual components of the system. The system should be backed up with a frequency that ensures system and course data is protected. Since assignments will be submitted via the system, it should be backed up on a nightly basis, with options for weekly, off-site backup when necessary.
The system must have the ability and capacity to restore back-up data within six hours so that the system is never offline for an inordinate period of time.
The system should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
This statement provides a general sense of system availability. It is not intended to demand the system maintain reliability, or to require the system to be highly available. It should not exclude maintenance windows, or scheduled downtime. It is only intended to convey the expectation that our customers should have access to the system during off-hours as well as business hours. 99% up-time should be considered sufficient to meet this requirement.
Users must have easy access to help while interacting with the system. Adequate user documentation should be provided to minimize the number of calls to the Help Desk about problems with the system. Modifications should be reported via the main page to inform actors of unexpected changes. This electronic documentation should be supplemented with phone and on-site support provided by the Office of Information Services.
System administrators must have access to comprehensive, searchable documentation.
A comprehensive database of maintenance tasks and help files should be compiled to make the courseware system easier to maintain from an IT staff point-of-view. Search results should be displayed based on relevance.
This documentation must cover all procedures necessary for regular maintenance with links to additional information, all common errors, and links or documentation for advanced troubleshooting.
The system must be maintainable without substantial modification.
Due to limited staff in the Office of Information Services, it is important that the system be mostly self-sustaining. This will reduce the number of FTE hours spent maintaining the system and simplify maintenance tasks.
Although any courseware solution may be composed of diverse systems, applications, and processes, the underlying architecture should be transparent to the administrators. The system should be configurable from a single source at a central administrative position, and should provide a central, easy-to-use interface that will allow administrators to configure the user interface and features in a way that reduces page clutter.
The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users.
This statement provides a general sense of reliability when the system is under load. It is important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time, since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it. The times when the system will be under the most stress are likely during midterm and finals weeks. Therefore, it must be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users.
The system must be backed up on a configurable schedule.
The system must allow actors in the capacity of course administrator to post grades associated with assignments for a particular actor in the capacity of student. Actors in the role of professor may want to optionally grade assignments online since they are being submitted electronically by actors in the role of student.
A course administrator must be able to grade an assignment.
The system must display a search box on every page after an actor has logged in.
Actors should be able to search from any page. If the actor is hierarchically outside of a particular course, each of his or her courses should be searched and results should be grouped by course. If the actor is hierarchically inside of a course, that course should be searched with an option to search all courses.
One of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on certain pages of the system. These might include assignment submission pages, forum pages, wiki pages, and announcement pages. An actor in the role of course administrator should be able to optionally upload multiple files where he or she finds that such as feature would be usefulâ€”such as on a devoted project page.
For this requirement, page refers to any distinct upload point (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.).
The system must allow for multiple file upload to be configured on a per-page basis.
Actors in the capacity of course administrator or professor should be able to enable multiple file uploads on a page of his or her choosing. For collaborative projects, it becomes important for actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page, especially in the case of an assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts. Such a construct should be offered to the actor during a pageâ€™s creation and editing stages.
The system must be able to capture and organize voice clips that can be used where appropriate.
One of the shortcomings of the current courseware system is that the foreign language department is unable to capture and track voice clipsâ€”recorded by studentsâ€”for oral homework over the course of a studentâ€™s education.
The system must allow actors to organize their voice clips into a portfolio.
Equal and finite drive space needs to be allotted to each actor in the role of professor or administrator to allow for the storing of voice clips recorded and submitted by all actors in the roles of students. Actors in the role of professor or system administrator should be allowed to partition this space for actors in the roles of students. This can be done one of two ways: 1) the actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or not he or she would like that clip to be archived, or 2) a newly created voice clip can be automatically archived. The first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an archive of voice clips. The actor should have the option to have the voice clip be archived after a preview has taken place. The second option would automatically archive a voice clip once submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file. Thus, if the actor chooses to delete the file, it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips.
Maintaining an archive of voice clips makes it possible for comparisons to be made between clips to determine whether an actor is improving his or her language skills over multiple courses. The actor should be able to optionally attach one of his or her archived items to any page where uploads are permitted.
The term archive used above may also be referred to as a portfolio.
The system must allow actors to download their voice clips in a flexible format.
Voice clips should be optionally downloadable in a format such as MPEG Audio (mp3) format, since it is widely supported across different web browsers and operating systems. Voice clips should be downloadable for archival purposes or for the purpose of presenting them to other actors.
The system must store audio clips in a format conducive to speech.
The system must be able to capture and manage files where appropriate.
The system must allow actors to delete recorded clips.
In addition, the search page described above might allow for the possibility of searching the world wide web using a standard search engine such as Google.
Second, a single page should be dedicated specifically to the task of searching the course management system. In addition to the basic search field, this page should allow an actor to filter out certain results (such as forum posts or grades, etc.) and search specific sections (or components) of the course management system. Results should appear in categories (e.g., Assignments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts, etc.) based on relevance. In this case, relevance is determined by results that having the highest number terms matching the search terms. When the actor clicks a search result link, they should be taken to the page corresponding to the search result.
First, it should be present in the form of a search box and a â€œSearchâ€� button on the top or bottom of every page. More information on this topic is given in sub-section 3.4.2 below.
Actors should be able to search for pages at the course level, since most actors will be searching for material in a given course. The search feature should be present in two ways.
Voice clips should be stored in a format optimized for speech since this feature is meant to catalog voice recordings. Recordings should only be converted to MPEG Audio (mp3) format when they are being downloaded; a separate viewer should be provided in a cross-platform language for listening to clips in Moodle.
Moodle can be difficult to navigate and requires too many clicks to be efficiently used. Too many steps to complete basic actionsâ€”such as submitting an assignmentâ€”lead to frustration on the part of the actor. A search utility enables actors to find what they are looking for quickly in addition to having a hierarchical approach to finding functions of the course management system. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page, such as an assignment, a wiki page, or a forum post.
An actor must be able to search through pages in a course.
Actors in the course administrator role may not feel the need to provide web feeds for every page in their course. During the creation and editing of a page, that actor should be able to toggle web feed availability.
The system must allow web feeds to be turned on or off on a per-page basis.
If actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in Moodle, they are unable to efficiently keep track of a courseâ€™s current affairs. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct block (e.g., assignments, wikis, forum threads, etc.).
The system must be able to display web feeds, such as RSS 2.0 feeds, for all pages of the course management system where elements such as forum posts, assignment postings, announcements, wiki alterations and other blocks of information that an actor may view are added. Actors in the role of course administrators should have the ability to determine which of these components have feeds and to whom these feeds should pertain.
Since voice clips should be stored in a portfolio for each actor during his or her existence in the course management system, he or she should be able to examine his or her portfolio to select and delete clips if he or she chooses to. This allows him or her to manage archived voice clips and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use to judge improvement over time.
The system must be able to use search functionality as a way to navigate Moodle pages instead of using hierarchical links.
The external users need to be able to click on an area and obtain data for the surrounding area, such as lapsed quantities, historical use, and adjacent permits. Need to support decision-making on the applicant s part, especially when their request does not meet the MFL requirements.
Make the following property appraiser data available so you can improve the ability to project service area populations in inter-Census years in several ways: Provide a more discreet and up-to-date count of housing units in a utility service area, Help determine when a DRI is completed, Match commercial properties by the connection data provided by utilities, Use lot sizes, where available, to determine its role in household water use compared to other variables in research projects, There may be other data of use as well (wells, pools, etc).
Update interval protocols for updating different data types.
Populate missing data in the database, especially permits and pumpage reports.
A web application is preferred. If ArcMap, has to be able to run in Citrix ArcView.
The tools the system will use to access the data need to be better than what is available now.
The data has to be accurate.
Data to support requirements must exist in the database, and be readily available.

Provide the ability to obtain data necessary to determine and access the population estimates for an area or on a permit-by-permit basis. Needs to accommodate how it is determined now and how it will be determined under the SWUCA 2 rules. This would include: Seasonal residential report based on AHCA hospital report (determine seasonal populations).
Report compliance on a permit (not wells). Crop reports on permits (not wells) (I think this was a requirement to report this data some how at a well level).
Capture crop report data and link it with the corresponding use quantities, so you can observe changing crop patterns, see where land has shifted out of crops, and track water use per planted acre per crop to see patterns in water use by geography. The accumulation (or depletion) of credits by geographic area could point out potential problems in permitting in specific geographic areas. It may point to soil type or local cultural practice problems. Link to requirement JY4/SR7, the report of water credits used and earned.
Need tool to be able to estimate water use (now being done in SAS). To do this estimate, you need to be able to query the water use data with various variables, such as time period, use types, withdrawal type (groundwater or surfacewater), and geographic areas. Once the initial query is complete, you need to be able to refine the resulting data set. An example is when you select active permits in a time period. If a permit expired inside of the time period, the refine tool would help determine if that permit would or would not be a part of the result set, perhaps by determining at what point in the time line it expired.
Use GIS layers to analyze how salt-water intrusion is affecting water quality, etc. Layer would need to be updated either quarterly or annually.
Ability to provide external customers a means to query and view application information and locations by entering spatial, temporal, or data specific information. Current applications satisfying the criteria would be viewed immediately; future applications would be e-mailed.
Compare the population reported to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR) report.
Calculate water quality trends by geographic area.
Link between Water Use Permits (WUP), Environmental Resource Permits (ERP), and Well Construction Permits. One use would be as a means of notifying appropriate District staff when pertinent land use changes. (i.e. want to know if an ERP is issued or applied for a subdivision where permit has been issued for a farm.)
The ability to access crop report information spatially and temporally.
Provide access to population data in system that are aggregated to appropriate geographic areas (services areas, counties, etc.).
Ability to add estimated quantities for unmetered permits, which is found in the Water Estimates Database.
If toolbars are written, must be in .dll format.
Access well construction data for domestic wells using locational data, such as GPS or section, township, and range.
Consider the ease of deployment of application.
Ability to customize queries.
Need technical documentation for maintainability.
Use system to publish a chart or graph that compares the MFL to a running average of AFL s. This should reflect how the AFL s are moving along the MFL line and indicate how different resources impact the MFL. The resources to include are pumpage, new projects, and rainfall. It will probably be run on a monthly basis.
Reasonable refresh rates.
Application must fit into statutory time frames for evaluating permitting applications, so there must be a quick turn-around time.

The data has to be available in real time.
Need to receive job-specific training and support.
The same datasets need to be used by all departments or sections of the District.
A process needs to be established so corrections to the source data sets can be initiated, i.e. when errors are discovered when running models.
System has to be user-friendly.
Develop and make readily accessible metadata for the data (i.e. need to know the time frames when the data is considered to be good)
Have consistent way to report on permit status and withdrawal status.
The value you enter should be the actual data value, not any code number associated with it.
Hire a metadata librarian to manage data associated with the Water Use Tracking project.
Support consistency in decision-making among various users.
Replicate the DB2 data daily in Oracle.
Need quick access to currently published information to base decisions on.
Follow District programming standards.
System should be written in map.net â€“ either VB or C#.
Do not join features based on the shape column.
Follow District change management standards.
Can extend the current District architecture, i.e. Oracle Spatial, if needed.
Minimum lake levels - The proposed MFL is achieved when the long-term P50 is at or above the MFL and the long-term P10 is at or above the High Minimum Lake Level for five consecutive years. Once in compliance, MFL is not met when the long-term P50 is below the MFL for two or more consecutive years or the long-term P10 is below the High Minimum Lake Levels for two or more consecutive years.
Need to know what aquifer is being pumped from. There are permitting constraints in ETB MIA that no additional water from the Floridan Aquifer can be pumped, but it is allowed from Intermediate aquifer.
Minimum aquifer level - The saltwater intrusion MFL is met when the moving 10-year AFL is at or above the MFL for five consecutive years. The MFL is not met when the 10-year moving AFL in the reference wells is below the MFL for two consecutive years.
Track ownership of wells or permits over the life of the withdrawal point so the relocated quantities can be traced from owner to owner. Quantities that are relocated will have certain restrictions placed on them, as well as any quantities that remain on the original permit. For permits that have multiple withdrawal points, we need the ability to track ownership of specific withdrawal points over time.
Report the Reservation from use amounts allocated to certain participants.
Be able to determine the availability of alternative use supplies, such as reclaimed water and desalination.
Supply the Regulatory requirements of MFL data: What water levels are in relationship to MFL so you know who has to mitigate or how much excess flow there is, Need the historic and current levels so applicant knows how much to mitigate or what is available.
Report on competing applications (including ones that are in modification or expiring).
Report compliance on a permit (not wells). Crop reports on permits (not wells).
Should allow comparison to adjacent districts GIS layers to permit GIS layer to access adjacent data.
Report on the permit duration (To track expiration dates for those looking for someone to compete with).
Report on how much water was made available through the District s water resource development projects. Elements of the report should be: Source of benefit (aquifer or surface water), The locations of the alternative sources, What permits are using the quantities generated by the projects, and what project they are getting the water from.
For mitigation of MFL impacts, report on the improvement percentage amount, where it was located, the cost, how the decrease was obtained and what impacts it had.
Report on any water use amounts sold or given from one permit to another permit, especially reclaimed water (reclaimed water can be taken away, depending on the contract. It is kind-of-like â€œleasingâ€� the water, but can be taken away).
Create layer that includes "cones of depression" for the MFL information, which will indicate the area of influence to an MFL.
Identify when a standby permit is reactivated due to the loss of alternative quantities.
Mark those permits that have a land use change so the quantities can be relocated to the public supply utility.
Report on the permits that have been relocated by a permit holder.
Heat map for water quality. Add the District WUPnet sentinel wells on this map - those are the District wells that have been in existence the longest time and we have the best data with. So if we bring them up in an area we know we have reliable data.
Create heat map indicating who was over-pumping, who was not over-pumping, or who was using their water credits.
View the spatial impact of a person s application with other active applications on-line so the applicant or evaluator has a visual of who else is available to compete for quantities with. Also include application and permit data on-line, either with scanned documents or access to database. The historical data should also be available, but viewing restrictions for certain legal documents has to be followed. Be able to query by geographic area or permit number.
Conservation (defined as a beneficial reduction of water use resulting in: modification of water use practices, reduction of unaccounted-for losses, or installation and maintenance of low volume water use systems, processes, fixtures, or devices.
Track and measure alternative source projects: Surface water or stormwater projects, Reclaimed water (reuse water), Augmented surface water (reservoirs, harvesting of high flows (floodwaters), ASR (Aquifer storage recovery), Desalination.
Track and report on the history of permitted data, such as use type, irrigated acres, and pumpage (one use would be to know whether expired permits have had quantities reallocated).
Report on the history of irrigation water conserving credits, including the balance, how much earned, and how much used, and drought quantities. Know who uses them and who has accumulated them, and be able to report on an individual basis, by a geographic area, or aggregate the data.
Track the movement of lapsed quantities in an area, including: Which permit and well obtained the lapsed quantities, Where the lapsed quantities are located, Why the quantities are lapsed (i.e. expired, cancelled, retired), What MFL zone the lapsed quantities are in.
Track the relocation of active water use within the SWUCA.
Minimum flows on the upper Peace River - The MFL is met when the MFL s are at or above the established MFL for three consecutive years. Once the MFL has been considered met, if it is followed by two years where the MFL is not met within a rolling ten-year period, then the AFL shall be considered below the MFL. A determination of whether AFL s are meeting the established MFL is made at each one of the established minimums (Bartow, Ft. Meade and Zolfo Springs).
Track the impact that water use has to the set MFL levels. In particular, compare the affects of the new or modified use to the actual flow and level of the water body or aquifer to make sure the actual level will not go below the MFL level. Types of things to check are: New applications, renewals, or modifications, Relocated uses, Change of use type, Lapsed quantities, Retired permits (some are lapsed - some are not).
Have a heat map that shows permit information for specific time periods. You should be able to input a geographic area (whether by county, department, or entire District area), select the time period(s) you want, and select one of two views: permits issued or active permits in that time period, and produce the map show the locations. On a high-level view, you need to be able to see the locations with the predominate use type reflected on the map itself, and include a graph or chart showing the total number of permits, predominate use shown by %, and the time period involved. If you click on it, bring up the permit details, such as name, permit number, issue date, expire date, use type, wuca, and average quantities.
Be able to look at permitted quantities, actual quantities (pumpage), and the resources it uses (Water Management DB)
Ability for public utilities and internal staff to find existing permits in or near their service area so they can spatially see what water is available, or may become available, when they plan for their future growth and water resources. They will need to view the use type (interested mainly in agricultural and mining), owned acres, and the current permittee s contact information.
Need a protocol to assess how the actual flow and levels (AFL) compare to the established minimum flows and levels (MFL), including general trending information and whether waterbody-specific criteria are being met. There are 3 major provisions to track:
Obtain report of those out of compliance of permit conditions by over-pumping their allowable quantities. Show how much over pumping is done, and have option to select by time period or by area. Need to break down to a permit-by-permit basis, but also show the whole thing on a map.
Track permittees not submitting conditional/pumpage reports, and generate a map showing their locations.
Track pumpage oddities. Two examples are: A. Permittees that have consistent pumpage readings even when some of the data is missing. Use this information to predict whether they are in compliance in spite of the missing data. B. Permittees that enter zero on their pumpage reports.
Identify what lakes are stressed, when they became stressed, and if/when they came off stressed list.
Create layer that shows the Developments of Regional Impacts (DRI) and their status. This layer will be plugged into the new model for population projections and water supply demand projections.
Track aquifer level changes, lake level changes, rainfall level changes, and stream flow changes by area over time (i.e. monthly).
Support extraction or reporting of data for ad-hoc geographic areas by using spatial queries such as graphics or polygon buffering. The ability to aggregate the data must be there and any type of polygon should be able to be used.
Know how much water has been permitted and how much has been used based on land use over time.
Identify different types of water use, such as groundwater, surface water, and re-use.
Show the intensity of water use in a geographic area on a color-coded map.

The system should allow the Construction Junction Staff to create new reports whenever required to satisfy their changing operational and business needs.
The application is expected to operate via touch screen user interfaces, and take advantage of that technology to be as fast, efficient, intuitive, and flexible as possible while also minimizing the potential for errors and duplications. It should minimize the use of keyboard and mouse when processing acquisitions, and should allow acquisitions to be completed with few clicks and page switches.
Donation/acquisition processing - The system must be available during normal Construction Junction operating hours.
Sales processing - The system must be available during normal Construction Junction operating hours.
Inventory management - The system must be available beyond normal operating hours to accommodate inventory management operations.
The system must be written using industry best practices, and must be built using only Construction Junction approved products and technologies. The system must also be written in such a way that it can be supported by planned Construction Junction staffing levels.
The system should record changes to application entities in the form of â€žcreated user/timeâ€Ÿ, â€žmodified user/timeâ€Ÿ fields. The system should also record information about various sensitive inventory management operations such as deleting items and changing the price of items.
The functionality provided by the Inventory Management System will be critical to the normal operation of the Construction Junction business. As such, the system should perform with consistently and predictably low response times in order not to impact the performance or the timely execution of the various tasks that need to be conducted by the Construction Junction staff.
The system should be able to generate reports based on the following entities, including reports that correlate them: Inventory items, Inventory departments, Inventory categories, Acquisitions Donors.
The following copyright notice must be displayed in all user interfaces: Â© 2009 - Construction Junction
Access to the application by the Construction Junction staff must require user login. Access to application screens and functions is granted or denied based on the profile and role of the currently logged in user, as detailed in the preceding use-case requirements.
The application will provide a reporting mechanism that, at a minimum, allows Construction Junction to review and report by inventory, inventory type, donor contact information, and the ability to link inventory to individual that donated it.
The system must be available beyond normal operating hours to accommodate website use â€“ Inventory listing, wish list management and online purchases.
Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt. They cannot, however, add items to the inventory or complete the acquisition process. A Receiving Associate is required to review all the acquisition information before those actions can take place.
The system should provide a categorized view of the entire inventory to the Construction Junction staff. Starting at the department level, users can navigate into the inventory item categories and subcategories, all the way down to an individual inventory item.
The system should allow inventory administrators to customize the inventory structure by defining the inventory departments (not to be confused actual retail floor departments known later in this document as stocking locations).
The system should allow inventory administrators to customize the inventory structure by defining the inventory departments and categories.
Any item in the inventory may be purchased by a Construction Junction customer. The sale of the item is processed by QuickBooks POS and the inventory must be updated accordingly.
Items are typically added to the inventory as part of the donation processes. This is called adding an item in donation processing. Alternatively, items can be added during routine inventory maintenance. This is called adding an item in inventory management mode.
The system should allow inventory administrators to customize the attributes and details available for each inventory item. Attributes can be defined for each department, and details can be defined for each department and/or category
The system should assist in the task of pricing a new inventory item by making pricing suggestions to the user when adding to or modifying an item in the inventory. The suggested prices should be calculated based on the original and sale prices of similar items that currently exist or existed in the inventory in the past.
Acquisition records for Drop-Off, Pickup and Decon donations are created in the CRM system. Inventory Management users should be able to view all past and current acquisitions. Receiving Associates use this function to locate an expected acquisition when receiving a donation at the loading dock. Pickup and Decon crews may also use this function to initiate the process of receiving items while in the truck, on their way to the receiving dock.
Drop Off acquisitions are not typically pre-scheduled as Pick Up and Decon acquisitions except for those submitted through the organizational website. As such, when a donor arrives with an unexpected drop off donation, a new acquisition needs to be able to be created in the CRM system first, at either the customer service desk or at the dock, before it can be viewed in the acquisitions screen.
A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated. Alternatively, a donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving Associate before items can be received and processed.
The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process, allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt. Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served. The Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.
The system should allow various management actions to be performed on items existing in the inventory. These include modifying, deleting and splitting an item, and viewing the itemâ€Ÿs details and item history. These actions are only available for Unique and Stock items.
The system generates a list of items that have been in-transit for more than X days (X configurable), per branch and per system. The report would merge the transit to and transit from into one report for ease of front-line staff use.
The system provides reports of missing and damaged items per branch.
System provides a utility for transferring batches of items between branches, used for example to move books into a mobile library, an outreach program collection, or a "just-in-time" warehouse. Utility includes ability to query for candidate materials; ability to save queries for repeated use; ability to manually select titles from query results; and ability to change records of all or selected items to move to new location. Mechanisms for moving items include changing location field, generating pull lists, etc. In addition, utility provides means to revert items to original location after a set period of time, and/or based on other criteria.
Ability to control inventory of uncataloged material, such as paperback books and children s board books. Support for quick distribution; minimal branch labor; and ability to identify how the material is being used. Ability to count transactions and include in circulation statistics and reports.
System must be able to support the fine-grained reports requirements as described in Appendix B.
The system provides an interface showing capacity of all branches
Ability to report on the volume of material in a given library at any point in time, based on new acquisitions, items on the shelf, and items out in circulation, with the ability to break down volume in categories (e.g. total items in library, number of holds, number of adult fiction, number of board books, etc).
The system produces useful demographic statistics, including transactions by geographical regions, age ranges, etc. The data used to produce these statistics must be anonymized, i.e. information that could be used to identify a patron is deleted.
The system produces statistics that can be used to understand and predict patron behavior and use of materials. For example, how quickly is a particular book returned, on average? How likely is a particular book to be renewed? What percent of check-outs at a particular branch are renewals?
The system provides a utility and reports for identifying item records to purge, based on customizable criteria such as: an item has been in status "missing" for more than X months; an item has status "discard/weed". The system has a report to assist in the conversion of items from one status to another. The system provides a last copy report that would single out a library system s last copies, to assist catalogers who need to edit WorldCat entries. The system provides a quick effective method of deleting volume entries along with copy entries, as well as records with no items attached.
For each genre and format of material, ability to compare the percentage of total circulations, the percentage of the collection, and the percentage of total shelf space that genre/format comprises. Ability to report per library and per system.
Ability to count and track record deletions (e.g. item records, patron records) per location and per system.
The system counts all types of check-out individually and cumulatively: staff check-out, self check-out, staff renewal, self checkout renewal, online renewal, OPAC renewal.
The system generates a list of patrons with no circulation or electronic activity in the last X days (X configurable). List should be configurable to System, Home Library, County, etc.
Transaction history is maintained for X days (X is configurable); monthly and annual aggregate information is maintained indefinitely.
Transactions can be grouped by hour, terminal, branch, and system. Transactions include check-ins, check-outs, fines collected, patron registrations, etc., and can be queried by all transactions or by type of transaction.
The system counts all types of check-in individually and cumulatively: book-drop, by terminal, by user or self-service.
The system counts all hold requests, including how the hold was placed: at a staff desk, at a public computer inside the library, or remotely.
The system can generate a report of transactions (holds placed, holds filled, and check-outs) per patron, per library, per selected group o libraries, per system, per county. The system displays the number of check-outs and placed holds per patron. Holds are subtotaled by type, e.g. active, frozen, and frozen-until holds.
The system can generate a report of the value of items (based on data in item record) in the entire collection or a portion. Example: staff can obtain value of all items with status of longoverdue, or value of all dvds in children s collection, or value of entire collection.
All reports and data archiving must comply with standard accounting practice and state, county, and municipal auditing requirements.
Fines, charges, waivers, and ecommerce transactions are attached to patron and item records. System tracks fines waived and payments made per library. Financial information can be updated easily. As an example, a staff user can easily query patron accounts with balances greater than X dollars.
The system provides financial reports including: patron account balances by patron, home library, and system; fines and charges accrued per time period (e.g. last twelve months, YTD, last month) and per type of charge (overdue fines, damaged item charges, lost item charges, etc.); fines waived per time period and per branch; payments made per time period and per payment method (e.g. staff desk, self-check station, OPAC).
System must be able to support the reporting definitions as described in Appendix A.
The system maintains a ledger of patron payments, including which charges payments are applied to, to facilitate reconciliation.
Ability to see where your report is in the queue of reports waiting to run.
Queries and reports can be limited or grouped by various patron characteristics, including: age range, zip code, county of residence, home branch, patron type, and preferred language.
Examples of periodic reports: bibliographic records with holds; items that have not been checked out in X days; item-level holds; items with invalid item type; in-transit items with outstanding hold; items that have been in-transit for more than X days; items that are the last copy in the system; items with a long call number; missing items; bibliographic records with no item records; patrons with invalid home library.
Management Processes support the needs of a large, multiple-system library consortium and its individual component systems and branches. Specifically, the system must support a library consortium with 286 locations, 17 million annual circulations, purchasing and processing over 900,000 items per year. It is highly desirable that searches and reports can be processed during open hours without disrupting other system functions.
Management Processes shall operate on a Linux or Solaris server.

System administrators can create reliable report templates that are available to staff, and can be run as is or modified to the staff person s particular needs. Changes in the templates could be done without comprising the results. The administrator can limit the filters and display fields that can be altered to certify a dependable output. For example, front-line staff could set the call number range for a weeding report or add or remove designated display fields from a pick list, but couldnâ€™t alter the template to display deleted items.
System provides distinct, fine-grained permission levels limiting who can create and clone reports. All permissions should be easy to administer. System administrators can create shared folders to allow or disallow staff to run specific reports, and/or to run ad hoc reports on specific sets of data.
System provides a user-friendly interface for designing queries against all record types. Staff can select fields to query; select values from picklist of possible values; select regular expressions from drop-down menu, and use a full range of Boolean operators. Administrators control staff access to tables and fields.
The system provides pre-defined reports for consumption by library boards or other consumers. There will be reports providing basic statistics like those required by the Georgia Annual Report and Application for State Aid and activity reports that indicate traffic and volume of use that display statistics on check-outs, check-ins, holds placed, and holds filled. It should be possible cross-tabulated per terminal, per branch, per library system, per hour, per patron age range, per patron type, and per patron location.
Transactions are archived in a form that protects patron privacy as defined by State Law, while providing useful demographic statistics.
System provides the query selections along with the results.

Hence, adoption and approval procedures have to be defined and enacted in order to install the pre-VCD mapping and pre-VCD mapping tool as an official mapping model.
Precondition: The adoption of the model requires a parallel effort from the legal side to compare whether the provisions of existing NPPAs can get a harmonization through the referencing to the EU directive. This is a major requirement to drive the action of contracting authorities that have strict obligations to follow while performing in a tendering procedure.
Centralized or decentralized infrastructure? Will there be one centralized system on a European level hosting and providing the mapping or a decentralized system consisting of interconnected national systems? In the latter case, one could define that each national system only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary. A decision to deploy either a centralised or a decentralized infrastructure that provides the mapping service MUST be made.
By which technical means will the mapping be provided? The technical means to provide the mapping service has to be defined in dependence on the choice of the pilot solution. The simplest form without any technical support could for example consist in the one-time distribution of mapping tables in paper-based form. Another solution could consist of a web-based access to a system providing the mapping by querying an underlying database which contains the mapping table. A more advanced solution would be an automated processing of the mapping according to the relevant criteria that therefore have to be specified by the contracting authority in a dedicated electronic format. Also the higher maturity levels defined in this vision (stage 2-4) can use the mapping service in order to retrieve the mapping information. It MUST be defined by which technical means the mapping service will be provided.
Which entity will host the mapping facility? In dependence of the choice of infrastructures (centralised â€“ decentralized) and the organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping facility it has to be defined who will be responsible to host the mapping facility. An entity that hosts the mapping facility MUST be defined in dependence of the type of infrastructure and the dedicated governing model.
Liability: In law a legal liability is a situation in which a person or organisation is financially and legally responsible. The liability of the organisation that governs infrastructure and mapping facility has to be defined in order to ensure trust into the system and particular mapping results? â€¢ The Liability of organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping facility MUST be defined
Sustainability: Sustainability is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state into the future. The governing model must ensure that the state of the mapping system will be kept over time. Therefore the mapping system has to be based on the commonly agreed mapping and no changes are allowed without a common agreement. â€¢ The mapping facility MUST ensure sustainability of the system over time based on commonly agreed mapping schemes.
The mapping facility MUST be accessible to all relevant key stakeholders such as economic operators, contracting authorities, certifiers and national service providers.
The interaction between mapping facility and Publication Body / Contracting Authority SHOULD be defined in order to simplify the procedure to retrieve the relevant criteria for a particular Call for Tender.
It MUST be clearly defined which economic operator data are sensitive and belong to identity and access management.
A single-sign on SHOULD be implemented in order to allow identity and access management across different systems.
The identity and access management procedures for creating a VCD account SHOULD be harmonized with the registration procedure of the overall infrastructure provided by WP8.
The rule set derived from legal requirements concerning â€œevidence checkingâ€� MUST be defined.
The VCD system MUST have the status of a trusted system.
Superset of evidences: The formal representation will become necessary as a reference data set for the mapping operations showing the relationship between all attestations.
The right granularity and consistency of criteria MUST be found through testing and iterative redefinition in order to ensure legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results.
VCD system MUST be operated by at least one national VCD service provider
Transport mechanisms between partyâ€™s addresses MUST be secure.
A functionality to display context specific data SHOULD/MUST be included within any VCD.
A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to initiate the creation of a VCD advanced package.
A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to provide existing VCD packages of other economic operators when specific disclosure options have been activated.
A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to check, whether the structural VCD package data of existing VCD packages of other economic operators are consistent with the VCD advanced package schema of other economic operators, or not
A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to check, whether the tender specific data of existing VCD packages are consistent with the tender specific data of other VCD packages.
A standard representation of common criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion MUST be defined according to Articles 45-50 of Directive 2004/18/EC.
A VCD system MUST provide functionality to compile the data which result from the evidence collection process and the data provided by the economic operator in the VCD advanced package creation. The types of data which have to be compiled into a VCD advanced package are therefore: - Structural VCD package data - Structural data of evidence - Tender specific data - Economic operator data - Context specific data - Evidence - Authorized translation of evidence
VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to initiate the recompilation of an existing VCD package into a VCD advanced package.
A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator for uploading an existing VCD package
A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to decompose an existing VCD package
A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to identify outdated or obsolete evidences
A VCD system must provide a functionality to retrieve actual instances of outdated evidences
The VCD system MUST provide functionality and an interface to the economic operator that enables him to mandate a certain contracting authority to request attestations on demand.
A VCD system MUST provide functionality to merge the following data from several existing VCD packages of other economic operators: - Structural VCD package data - Structural data of evidence - Tender specific data - Economic operator data - Context specific data - Evidence - Authorized translation of evidence
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that enables National VCD Service Providers to store attestations.
The VCD system MUST detect which attestations can be used by this feature (e.g. they have to be sufficiently described through context specific data and structural data of evidence).
The rule set derived from legal requirements concerning subcontracting and other consortium constellations MUST be defined
A formal procedure to make changes to the system MUST be defined.
The VCD system SHOULD provide a functionality to approve attestations through validation data and to make this approval visible within a VCD networked package when a National VCD Service provider takes the role of a national validation point in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC and EFTA EEA Committee decision 68/2006.
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that initiates a conflict resolution process between economic operator and contracting authority if errors occur or when certain attestation or a translation cannot be delivered on demand.
The VCD system MUST ensure that the attestation that is requested by the contracting authority is still valid at the time of awarding or when the Call for Tender is closed.
The mapping has to be easily maintainable which could be of interest in the case of changes of the legal basis on national or European level. A formal procedure has to be found how changes are applied to the system. Moreover an organisation or institution that governs the process of change management has to be defined.
The VCD system MUST provide a functionally to check whether a contracting authority has sufficient rights and has been mandated by the economic operator to retrieve attestations.
VCD-specific or contracting authority-specific reference to attestations MUST be stored within the VCD system (processing instructions).
The functionality for referencing to attestations within the VCD MUST be implemented, either VCD-specific or contracting authority-specific, in order to approve whether the contracting authority has sufficient rights for requesting the attestations.
The VCD system MUST ensure that a contracting authority is able to request attestations via the provided reference (including time-restrictions).
A functionality for referencing to attestations MUST be implemented within the VCD system.
The VCD system MUST provide a functionality and an interface that enables contracting authorities to retrieve the attestation from the storage.

Generation and transmission under the control of the Master of the vessel before entering into port at the time of inspection at sea at the request of the UK fisheries administrations.
The subject header must consist of a character string containing â€˜ERS â€“ â€˜ prefixed to the contents of the GBRRN attribute of the Electronic Logbook data being transmitted. The GBRRN attribute is defined in the UK XML/XSD. The GBRRN attribute is defined uniquely as the vesselsâ€™ RSS Number appended to the current date (in YYYYMMDD format) and a 6 digit sequence number, e.g. RSSNumber+YYYYMMDD+999999. An example of the contents of an email subject could be ERS â€“ A1234520090623000001.
The xml document file name should be based upon the GBRRN attribute defined in the UK XML/XSD. An example of this format could be A1234520090623000001. The RSS Number will require to be padded with trailing Xâ€™s to ensure that it is always 6 characters in length.
Each file should have the suffix of .xml, e.g. A1234520090623000001.xml.
All xml documents attached to emails to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system must be encrypted using PGP.
ELSS must only be supplied for use at sea and loaded onto an onboard system and is not to be provided for onshore use by agents or representatives. . Onshore entry is to be made through the ERS website or by use of the offline submission methods to be promulgated by the UK fisheries administrations, e.g. an emailed spreadsheet CSV formatted file. To this end the UK administrations will provide the Owner with the means for his agent(s) to logon to the ERS website to view the vessel trip record to date and the logbook numbers used, to aid their completion of the reports they wish to submit from their offices.
It is recognised that communications methods, other than email, are available for data transmission. If an alternative is proposed, this should be advised to the Validation Authority and if feasible and practicable the UK Fisheries Administrations will endeavour to extend their ERS system to accommodate alternative methods.
The ELSS must permit the Master of the vessel to generate formatted data for transmission to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system. There are 2 categories of transmission, those that must be generated automatically by the ELSS and those that can be generated and transmitted under the control of the Master of the vessel. The data transmission categories are specified below:
Automatically by the ELSS (subject to be overridden by the vessel master): at least on a daily basis not later than 24:00 even when there is no catch data with the proviso that if the vessel is in port, has no fish on board and has submitted a landing declaration, transmission may be suspended subject to prior notification to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre of the flag Member State. Transmission must be resumed when the vessel leaves port.
The ELSS must provide facilities to capture and deliver for transmission corrections to previously successfully transmitted data. Data corrections must not be transmitted piecemeal; the entire report containing one or more corrected items must be transmitted. There is no requirement to identify the data items that have been corrected in the generated corrected report.
The ELSS must be able to receive acknowledgement (RET) messages transmitted from the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system. The ELSS must match each acknowledgement message with the appropriate transmitted data operation, deletion or correction report. The ELSS must be able to confirm that a transmission has been successfully acknowledged or display any error message should the ELSS receive a negative acknowledgement message.
The ELSS must only permit correction messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the submission of the End of Fishing report for that voyage
The ELSS must provide facilities to transmit deletions to previously transmitted data.
The ELSS must only permit deletion messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the End of Fishing report for that voyage.
All deletions must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface.
Prior to registering a product for approval, a test address for all test email transmissions and test logon details to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system will be provided on request. All requests should be made by contacting the Validation Authority by email in the first instance. The email address is ERS-Logbook-Approvals@NCCGroup.com.
Once operational the UK XML/XSD allows for a test message to be sent to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system. This test facility must be used to send test transmissions to establish that the communications between the vessel and the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system are fully operational. The UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system will acknowledge any test messages but will not store any data that has been transmitted.
ELSS must retain all logbook reports and any corrections on the system at least until the end of each trip, i.e. on submission of the electronic landing declaration or of a transhipment report.
Any ELSS software updates must not impact upon the ELSSâ€™s ability to meet the requirements set out in this document and other test documentation . If it does then the product must be submitted for re-approval, and can not be deployed by fishing vessels until this is granted and the new version id is published on the UKFA web site lists
The ELSS should at least be able to transmit data via email, either by being included in a packaged solution with an email system or by linking with an existing on-board email service. Data is required to be emailed as an xml document attached to an email with a standard Subject header and sent to the email address of the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system.
All corrections must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface.
The ELSS must provide Electronic Logbook data for transmission to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system in accordance with the frequency requirements defined below (Section 5.1).
The ELSS may also provide the means for recording additional data but this must not interfere with the data capture and submission functions as set out below.
Additionally a formatted electronic print file may be generated out of the ELSS. This print file can be made available to a masterâ€™s representative on-shore, e.g. by email over the onboard communications system(s). The ELSS must provide a means so that electronic print files are protected so that they cannot be modified in any way once generated and distributed.
The ELSS may provide features to facilitate other print requirements including: Generation of hard copies of the Electronic Logbook required when fishing in 3rd country or Regional Fisheries waters, e.g. NAFO, Faroese and Norwegian waters, Generation of a hard copy logsheet or landing declaration to act as a transport or takeover document, Generation of a hard copy for providing regulatory returns for Cod and Hake effort reporting.
The ELSS must capture all data necessary for recording the fishing activities undertaken by a UK fishing vessel.
The ELSS must output the data as an XML file for transmission to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system.
The ELSS data must be validated against the UK XML/XSD before transmission from the fishing vessel.
The ELSS data must be transmitted at the required times.
Each ELSS data transmission will be acknowledged by a return message from the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system.
The owner is then able to set up subsidiary users such as the master of the vessel with their own username and password.
The username is required to be recorded in each report completed and in each transmission made; the person who has entered the data is required to â€œsignâ€� the Electronic Logbook data stating that they are aware of the responsibilities/liabilities they are committing to in completing and / or transmitting a report.
Each copy of the ELSS installed must be provided with a unique (internal?) number that is automatically entered into each transmission to identify the instance of the ELSS from which the report has been transmitted.
Data operation to capture and deliver formatted ELSS data for transmission by a vesselâ€™s communications system(s) to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system (DAT)
One username/password must be provided for the owner of each vessel
Correction operation to capture and deliver a formatted correction request for transmission by a vesselâ€™s communications system(s) to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system to correct previously send data (COR)
Delete operation to capture and deliver a formatted deletion request for transmission by a vesselâ€™s communications system(s) to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system to delete previously send data (DEL)
The Electronic Logbook data may be populated from other, existing, onboard electronic systems, e.g. a GPS for inserting the date, time and location of transmission, or for inserting the same items at the time of capture, onboard weighing systems, existing onboard database(s) to avoid duplication of data entry.
All dates and times must be UTC.
The ELSS must use English (UK) localizations for all UK Electronic Logbook features.
The ELSS must provide the ability to print out the ELSS logbook data (including landing declarations) using an onboard printer.
The data definitions also provide for the capture of data items required for the submission of ELSS data to meet 3rd country requirements, e.g. Norwayâ€™s requirements that include haul by haul reporting.
The data definitions for each report type that are required to be transmitted from the ELSS of a UK fishing vessel are to be found in the annex to this specification. The data definitions and associated lists of valid codes are incorporated in the UK XML/XSD definitions. These are available to all ELSS suppliers from the UK FMC.
Receipt of acknowledgment operation to match acknowledgement with original message and provide a record/report of acknowledged and un-acknowledged transmissions
The ELSS must provide data capture screens for the entry of the logbook, transhipment and landing declaration data that is required to be transmitted to the UK fisheries administrationsâ€™ ERS system.
As it has already been mentioned, GParted is not a resource hog and will run on almost every computer. Its functions and features are not computationally intensive. It does not require a powerful processor or graphics card, much RAM, or disk space, for both the install and Live version, and the program loads and runs fairly quick. The only real requirement is a CD/DVD drive or a USB port that is working properly.
GParted Live does not deal with any security or privacy issues, as it does not run from within an operating system. Every user has administrator rights and full access which are given from the start of the program, as you are logged in as root.
As it is stated with many warnings in the program, data loss is a serious possibility, if you are not careful, backup your data and/or use the program with extreme caution. It is obvious that when you deal with partition changes, you could lose all your data by human or application error. GParted comes with absolute no warranty and cannot be made responsible for any loss of data.
